Tutorial overview
=================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to reproduce each of the simulations
presented in the paper "Multistate lifetable modelling of preventive
interventions: Concept and Python code".
This will also allow you to adapt and modify these simulations, to explore the
impact of different model assumptions and interventions, and to capture
different simulation outputs of interest.

The structure of this tutorial reflects the order in which results are
presented in the accompanying paper.
